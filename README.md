* Pause the timer when the game is loading [after a death, after the status cutscene, when warping to the eye].<br>

## Troubleshooting
If you have any issue or question you can contact me on Discord `Nepo#2778` or send me a message on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/user/Nepo)<br>

__If you have an issue :__<br>
-Be sure that you do not have 'Scriptable Auto Splitter' in your Layout Editor [Right click on LiveSplit -> Click on "Edit Layout..." -> Select the element you want to delete and click on the *"-"* button].<br>
-Be sure that you followed the steps detailed in the __"How to use it?"__ section, check that you activated the Auto Splitter in the __Splits Editor__ and that the splits you want to use (and their parent options) are all checked in the __Options__.<br>
-A new Update or a mod being installed *could* impact the autosplitter, let me know if you notice anything.<br>
-You can install [DebugView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview) to see the comments, it probably won't help you though.<br>

__Known issueÂ·s :__<br>
-The initialization (and therefore the whole autosplitter) are not working for one person, likely because of an old computer/OS (Windows 7)<br>
